Communication is key.
- I would personally like to have a check in meeting every tutorial to catch up, see where everyone is at, see how everyone is feeling.
- Of course, Discord is always a good option incase someone needs to bring something up immediately, we're just not always available to answer right away

Work distribution
- Since there are 3 things we have to work on (Add item by scanning [before payment begins], Pay by credit card, GUI) and we have 6 members, maybe 2 members per part?
